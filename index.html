<p>  This is the repository for my first ever forage into the world of Python.  Code here for an agent based model where agents move around an environment, nibbling away at data and building up stores.  Some cooperative behaviour is included whereby nearby agents share their stores, contingent on a defined neighbourhood (a measure of proximity).  The code is animated to allow the user to see the gradual errosion of data through the random movement of agents.  This can be seen by a change in the colour of the underlying environment in the wake of each agent </br>
